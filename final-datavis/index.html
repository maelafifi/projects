              <p style="color:white; font-size:17px;"> 
                What motivated me to look into this? Well, a little while ago, I received an offer for an internship that pays pretty well. My sister,
                albeit happy for me, was upset that she could not find a decent paying job, to which I replied, "Should have studied something more
                useful, instead of getting a crappy degree." My mom then hopped into the conversation and said, "No matter what degree she got, women 
                still get paid much less than men, and it is harder for us to get jobs, anyways..." This made me furious. How can my mom, an owner of 6 
                degrees herself, say something like that. So we got to arguing, and I subsequently looked up a bunch of information on how women are paid 
                in comparison to men, explicitly in California. I found that women seem to enjoy relative equality in tech industries when it comes to pay, 
                but not when it comes to representation. This got me thinking: Is this the reason women are paid less? Are there not enough women in high-paying
                industries to the point that the wage ratio is significantly biased? These questions are attempted to be answered on this page.

          So, it looks like here we can pick out some problem areas in the United States. States like Wyoming, Louisiana, Utah, 
          and more seem to be worse off than most other states. New York, Calfornia, and Delaware seem to be ahead of the game in 
          closing the gender wage gap. What seems to be happening is that the states on either coast seem to be more forward on the
          issue, while the states in the center don't seem to care much. Some of these states are well below the average of 20 years 
          ago. Moreover, I've found that states witha higher tech population seem to have a smaller wage gap, while states with lower 
          tech populations seem to have a larger wage gap.

        <p style="color:black; font-size:14px;"> I've always known that women get paid less than men, but to what extent, I was unsure. The data 
          displayed in this scatter plot is of 119 different occupations. I isolated these particular occupations because they were the only 
          occupations that had no null values for men, women, or men and women combined. The data set sets a null value for the average weekly 
          income in the event that that particular gender has less than 50,000 persons occupying the particular occupation. Once those rows were 
          removed, I added an extra row that calculated the ratio of women to men pay. If the ratio was below .95, the row was given a 1 value; 
          if it was greater than .95 and less than 1.05, it was given a value of 2, and if it was greater than 1.05, it was given a value of 0.
          A zero value (women are paid higher than men) is extremely difficult to come by, as you should be able to see above. In ONLY TEN 
          occupations do women enjoy income equality, and even more scarcely, in ONLY TWO occupations do women enjoy a noticable difference in pay
           over their male counterparts. That leaves a whopping 106 occupations where men are paid noticably higher than their female counterparts.<br>
       So yes, but really, no... Women are very rarely paid equally, and even more scarcely are they paid higher than men.

        <p style="color:black; font-size:14px;"> 
          Upon looking at this data thoroughly, you can find out a few things: <br>1) Women are the majority in the bottom 20 paying jobs. <br>2) Men are the majority 
          in the top 20 paying jobs, and <br>3)Specifically looking at engineering fields in the sankey diagram, men are the OVERWHELMING majority.<br>
          This is obviously problematic. It seems clear to me that, although there are numerous factors playing into the wage gap, women need to start getting into the 
          engineering fields if they want to start making a dent in the wage gap. As students at the University of San Francisco, it is exciting that we are above the 
          average with respect to women in the CS Major, but it is also disheartening at how low that average is, to begin with.
