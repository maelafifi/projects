    </div>

    <section class="no-padding content">
    <h3>The Data</h3>
      <p>
      The primary dataset that was used in this project is from Bureau of Labor Statistics. The dataset consists of about 600 rows and 7 columns.
      The columns include an Occupation, Total Number of Workers, Average Pay of Worker, Total Number of Female Workers, Average Pay of Female Workers,
      Total Number of Male Workers, and the Average Pay of Male Workers. Each row in the data set defines the aforementioned columns based on the occupation
      of the current row. The data contains some NULL values. These values are there in the event that the number workers in a particular occupation is too 
      few (less than 50k). This helps to minimize the possibility of a lie factor in the data. 
      </p>
      <h3>Processing and Utilization: Scatterplot</h3>
      <p>
       The dataset used in the scatterplot is pretty straight forward. Using an SQl-esque statement in Tableau, I selected all rows from the dataset where there were no null values
        and I ended up with 119 total occupations where both, women and men had a minimum of 50k records. I then extraced only columns for average overall pay, 
        average womens pay, and average mens pay. I then wrote a very simple java program that read in my csv file of the aforementioned columns and calculated the 
        ratio of women:men pay in each particular occupation. The program subsequently appended a 0, 1, or 2 to a new text file, adding a new column that detailed 
        whether women are paid higher, lower, or similar in that particular occupation. In hindsight, it might have been smart of me to append the ratio to the new 
        file, as I do that work again when the d3 script is going through my now cleaned dataset.
      </p>
      <h3>Processing and Utilization: Sankey Diagram</h3>
      <p>
       Tableau is a very useful tool. It made my life a heck of a lot easier, overall, but the processing for this dataset was going to be tedious no matter what I tried. 
       Getting the values that I wanted for this data was simple. Tableau allowed me sort my data by the highest paying occupations, and I subsequently extracted the top 20 
       occupations and created a separate csv file. The same thing was done with bottom 20 paying occupations. Now for the hard part... I then had to manually write out a new
        csv file that included a source, target, and value column. From there, I had to connect every single data point, individually, to it's target destination. So, for Men, 
        I connected it to each field in the top 20 and each field in the bottom 20. That, in itself, is 40 lines of csv written. I then did the same thing for women. Similarly, 
        I had to connect other nodes based on how I wanted the sankey diagram to showup. A total of 122 lines of csv were typed to get this beauty, and I am thoroughly happy with 
        how this one, in particular, came out.

      <h1>Dataset 2: American Community Survey with US Census Bureau</h1>
    </div>
  <section class="no-padding content">
    <h3>The Data</h3>
      <p>
      The secondary dataset was compiled by the American Community Survey in conjunction United States Census Bureau. It was further compiled by the National Women's Law
       center. The dataset includes state income averages for males and females for each state, and ranks each state by it's women:men pay ratio. It also dialogues the wage 
       wage gap. There was no licensing information on the recompiled data, so I called the number on the web page that I found the dataset, and they said I would have no 
       issues utilizing their data, and it is publicly available for usage. They did give me the name of the particular survey that they used, although it is too large and 
       for me to comprehend. The survey name is: ACSB08007.
      </p>
   
      <h3>Processing and Utilization: </h3>
      <p>
        This dataset was really simple. I threw it into a text editor and replaced all tabs with commas (I prefer csv). The wage gap and rank were unused, so I subsequently 
        deleted those columns. The only columns that were used, however, were the state names, women pay, and men pay columns. I calculated my own ratio within the d3 code.
        The difficult part of this particular dataset was that it did not have any coordinates, so I had to find a map projection that actually had state names as identifiers. 
        Fortunately, a cool book called, "d3 Tips and Tricks v4.x" that is available on github had a solution for my dillema and I utilized their json file for my map projection.
