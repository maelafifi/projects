        <p style="color:black; font-size:14px;"> I've always known that women get paid less than men, but to what extent, I was unsure. The data 
          displayed in this scatter plot is of 118 different occupations. I isolated these particular occupations because they were the only 
          occupations that had no null values for men, women, or men and women combined. The data set sets a null value for the average weekly 
          income in the event that that particular gender has less than 50,000 persons occupying the particular occupation. Once those sets were 
          removed, I added an extra row that calculated the ratio of women to men pay. If the ratio was below .95, the row was given a 1 value; 
          if it was greater than .95 and less than 1.05, it was given a value of 2, and if it was greater than 1.05, it was given a value of 0.
          A zero value (women are paid higher than men) is extremely difficult to come by, as you should be able to see above. In ONLY TEN 
          occupations do women enjoy income equality, and even more scarcely, in ONLY TWO occupations do women enjoy a noticable difference in pay
           over their male counterparts. That leaves a whopping 106 occupations where men are paid noticably higher than their female counterparts.
        </p>
    <p>So the answer is yes, women ARE paid less than men, almost across the board.</p>

          So, it looks like here we can pick out some problem areas in the United States. States like Wyoming, Louisiana, Utah, 
          and more seem to be worse off than most other states. New York, Calfornia, and Delaware seem to be ahead of the game in 
          closing the gender wage gap. What seems to be happening is that the states on either coast seem to be more forward on the
          issue, while the states in the center don't seem to care much. Some of these states are well below the average of 20 years 
          ago.

        <p style="color:black; font-size:14px;"> 
          Actually, the interesting answer to why women are paid less than men is not that men are just a bunch of cruel people that 
          want to see women fail miserably so that they stay dependent on men. While I understand that rhetoric, and I also understand 
          societal norms, it is time for women to start occupying more higher paying jobs. If women don't start burowing their way into 
          higher paying jobs, no matter what happens, women will always statistically make less money than men.
