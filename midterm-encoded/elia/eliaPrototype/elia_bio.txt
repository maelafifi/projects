My name is Anaelia Ovalle, or Elia for short, and I am a senior data science student at the University of San Francisco located in the Bay Area. I moved to the United States from the Dominican Republic 4 years ago and aspire to be an applied data scientist. In that light, working with D3 and Tableau is a cool way to understand data and visualize it in an equally intuitive and aesthetically pleasing manner.
