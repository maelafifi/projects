This dashboard shows three visualizations of data regarding the San
Francisco Fire Department calls throughout the month of December, 2016.
All three visualizations take the numbers of calls throughout the month 
into consideration, while each visualization uses the number of calls 
differently. With each visualization, we can learn something different 
about the data and the SFFD.

For the first visual, the largest bubble is screaming MEDICAL, which not 
only tells us that medical incidents are the most overwhelming call types,
but it also begs the question as to why Medical incidents don't have a 
separate hotline. One might imagine that the SFFD should be dealing with 
fire related call types, but this is not the case. 

For the second visual, you'll find that, unsurprisingly, the number of 
calls are at their peak from 11AM until about 6PM, which is likely due
to the fact that most people are out and about doing things, working,
and the like. Call numbers significantly decrease during midnight until
6AM, also likely to be correlated with the number of people awake at 
those times.

For the third visual, cull numbers are mapped against districts, and 
priority. You'll notice that the original priority of calls ranges from 
1 to 3. Calls in the Tenderloin are significantly higher than any other
neighborhood. One other interesting thing to note from this visual is that,
across the board, it seems that Original Priority is just about half level 
3 and half level 2 for each district, and very rarely is the original 
priority level 1.
