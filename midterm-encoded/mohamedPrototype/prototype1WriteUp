This is a basic bubble plot chart with the x-axis equal to the time of day and the y-axis maps to the number of calls recieved.
The Number of Calls received were for fire department calls throughout the month of December, 2016.

There are two methods of embedded information in this graph, which both point to the same data: 
1) The darker the red, the more incidents that were called in for the month of December and that particular time. 
2) The larger the circle, the more incidents that were called in for the month of December and that particular time.
